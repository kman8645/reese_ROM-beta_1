> Super simplistic Multiplayer NES server in Go.

melody-jsnes is a demo project showing off Go's real-time web app
capabilities. Its design is straight forward, it just snapshots the
canvas of player one and sends it to player two and sends back inputs
from player two. Images data goes in direction, key codes in the other.
